A Telegram-oriented channel discusses group spam detectors and processors. Currently will:

- Scan all the *text* messages
- Handover all messages to Gemini, then require it to judge if the message is spam or not
- Delete the messages judged as spam
- Preserve *all* messages with judge result

Make @commSpamSlayerBot your discussion group’s admin and grant the “delete messages” permission. 
We recommend using this bot with group chats only for channel comments; it is not guaranteed for 
general group chats.
